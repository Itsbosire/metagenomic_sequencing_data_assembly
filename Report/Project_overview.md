# Assembly of Metagenomic Sequencing Data : Human Gut Microbiome

## Objective

The aim of this project is to perform metagenomic assembly of **human gut microbiome sequencing data** and evaluate the quality of the resulting assemblies.  

## Data

- **Source**: Publicly available raw sequencing reads of the human gut microbiome.  
- **Format**: Paired-end FASTQ files.  

## Workflow

1. **Quality Control**  
   - Tool: [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)  
   - Performed initial read quality assessment to check for sequencing errors, adapter content, and base quality distribution.  

2. **Assembly**  
   - Tool: [SPAdes (MetaSPAdes mode)](https://github.com/ablab/spades)  
   - Assembled high-quality reads into contigs for downstream analysis.  

3. **Genome Quality Assessment**  
   - Tool: [QUAST](https://quast.sourceforge.net/)  
   - Evaluated assembly quality metrics such as N50, total assembly length, number of contigs, and GC content.  

## Outcomes

- Generated assembled contigs from gut microbiome raw reads.  
- Produced assembly quality reports (QUAST) to guide interpretation.  

## Next Steps

- Functional annotation of assembled contigs.  
- Taxonomic classification of microbial species present.  
- Comparative analysis with other gut microbiome datasets.  
- Visualization of microbial community structure.
- Integration with clinical metadata for correlation studies.
